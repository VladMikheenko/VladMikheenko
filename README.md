ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Vlad Mikheenko, a back-end developer with a passion for complex systems and difficult tasks.
I believe that the best code is no code at all, or at least in succinct but not verbose code; 
that is why I use **Python**. 
Apart from it, I have experience in **Linux** (Debian-based distros), **PostgreSQL**, **Docker** and **Git**.<br>

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m primarily interested in asynchronous programming and system administration. Currently Iâ€™m learning advanced features of Python standard library (inspired by book "Python Cookbook"), asyncio, Linux, Computer Science theory. By the way, there are my projects (there will be more of them): https://github.com/VladMikheenko?tab=repositories
