ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Vlad Mikheenko, a back-end developer with a passion for complex systems and difficult tasks.
I believe that the best code is no code at all, or at least in succinct but not verbose code; 
that is why I use **Python**. 
Apart from it, I have experience in **Linux** (Debian-based distros), **PostgreSQL**, **Docker** and **Git**.<br>

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in asynchronous programming and, obviously, back-end development. <br> Iâ€™m currently learning ...<br>

ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
